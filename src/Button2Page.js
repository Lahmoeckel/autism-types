      <h1>Autism Level 2: Requires Substantial Support</h1>
      {/* Descrição */}
      <p>Individuals at this level require more substantial support. They may have more significant difficulties in social, communication, and behavioral areas, which can affect their ability to function independently in various aspects of daily life. They may need regular and structured support to deal with daily challenges.</p>
      <h1>The characteristics of autism type 2:</h1>

<p>
<li>1. Communication and Social Interaction Difficulties: Individuals with autism type 2 may struggle with both verbal and nonverbal communication, such as difficulty initiating or maintaining conversations, understanding others' perspectives, and interpreting social cues. They may prefer spending time alone and have difficulty establishing and maintaining friendships. </li>

<li>2. Restricted Interests and Repetitive Behaviors: Similar to autism type 3, individuals with autism type 2 may exhibit intense interests in specific topics and engage in repetitive behaviors, such as lining up objects, following rigid routines, or fixating on specific subjects.</li>

<li>3. Sensory Sensitivities: Many people with autism type 2 have atypical sensory sensitivities, being either hypersensitive or hyposensitive to stimuli such as light, sound, touch, or smell.</li>

<li>4. Varied Verbal Abilities: While some individuals with autism type 2 may have relatively developed verbal skills and speak fluently, others may have significant difficulties in speech and language comprehension.</li>

<li>5. Need for Support: Individuals with autism type 2 typically require support in some areas of life, such as communication, social interaction, routine management, and adapting to changes.</li>

<li>6. Variation in Severity: Autism type 2 falls in an intermediate point on the autism spectrum in terms of severity, with some characteristics more prominent than others depending on the individual.</li>

Once again, it's important to remember that autism is highly variable, and each person is unique, so these characteristics may manifest differently in each case.
