      <h1>Autism Level 3: Requires Very Substantial Support</h1>
      {/* Descrição */}
      <p>This is the most severe level of autism, where individuals need very substantial support. Individuals at this level may have severe difficulties in social, communication, and behavioral areas, which can significantly affect their ability to function independently. They may need intensive and ongoing assistance to deal with a wide range of challenges.</p>
      <p>The characteristics of autism type 3:
      <img src={diferences} alt="" width="460" height="345"/>

<li> 1. Significant Communication Challenges: Individuals with level 3 autism often struggle with both verbal and nonverbal communication. This can manifest as limited verbal skills, difficulty understanding or using body language, gestures, or facial expressions to communicate.</li>

<li> 2. Repetitive Behavior Patterns: People with level 3 autism frequently exhibit repetitive or stereotyped behaviors. This may include repetitive body movements (such as rocking or hand-flapping), rigid adherence to specific routines, or obsessive interests in certain objects or topics.</li>

<li> 3. Restricted Interests and Repetitive Activities: Level 3 autism is characterized by narrow and repetitive interests. Individuals may intensely focus on a single topic or activity, showing little interest in other areas.</li>

<li> 4. Social Interaction Difficulties: Significant social interaction difficulties are associated with level 3 autism. People may struggle to understand social norms, establish and maintain relationships with others, and engage in social play or conversation appropriately.</li>

<li> 5. Need for Substantial Support: Individuals with level 3 autism typically require substantial support across multiple areas of life, including communication, social interaction, daily functioning, and adaptation to changes in the environment.</li>

<li> 6. Sensory Issues: Many people with level 3 autism have atypical sensory sensitivities. They may be hypersensitive or hyposensitive to stimuli such as light, sound, touch, or smell, which can lead to sensory discomfort or overload.</li> 

<li> It's important to note that autism is a highly variable disorder, and each individual with autism is unique, so not all of these characteristics will apply to every person with level 3 autism.</li>
